				<h2>We Are Not In Kansas Anymore</h2>

				<p>The film begins in Kansas, which is depicted in a sepia tone. Dorothy Gale lives with her dog, Toto, on her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry's farm. Toto gets in trouble with a mean neighbor, Miss Almira Gulch, when he bites her. However, Dorothy's family and the farmhands are all too busy to pay her any attention. Miss Gulch arrives with permission from the sheriff to have Toto put down. She takes him away, but he escapes and returns to Dorothy, who then decides to run away from home, fearing that Miss Gulch will return.</p>

				<p> They meet Professor Marvel, a phony but kindly fortune teller, who realizes Dorothy has run away and uses his crystal ball to dupe her into believing that Aunt Em is ill so that she must return home. She races home just as a powerful tornado strikes. Unable to get into the storm cellar, she seeks safety in her bedroom. A wind-blown window sash hits her in the head, knocking her out. She then awakens to find the house has apparently been picked up and sent spinning up into the air by the tornado. She looks outside the window and sees several farm animals, an old lady sitting in a chair knitting, two men rowing a boat, and Miss Gulch, who transforms into a cackling witch flying on a broomstick.</p>

			<h3>Judy Garland and the Wizard of Oz</h3>
					<p>In 1938, she was cast in her most memorable role, as the young Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939), a film based on the 1900 children's book by L. Frank Baum. In this film, she sang the song with which she would be identified, "Over the Rainbow". Although producers Arthur Freed and Mervyn LeRoy had wanted her from the start, studio chief Mayer first tried to borrow Shirley Temple from 20th Century Fox, but they declined. Deanna Durbin was then asked, but was unavailable, resulting in Garland being cast.[34]</p>
